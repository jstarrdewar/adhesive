`adhesive` is a simple build tool that uses UglifyJS to concatenate your JavaScript and make you a nice source map.

I expect this to be most useful for simple, front-end focused projects, particularly those that are already working with a traditional list of `<script>` tags in `index.html` (and where you may not want to rock the boat).  There are [more sophisticated versions of this](http://yeoman.io/) out there, but `adhesive` has some advantages:
- There is very little configuration, so it won't take you more than a few minutes to get it working. 
- It __outputs source maps__ so you can easily debug the minified version of your code. 
- It's so simple that you can grab the repo and modify it to your heart's content â€” without spending very long learning how it works.

`adhesive` doesn't bother with css.  I usually have [compass](http://compass-style.org/) watching my scss files and combining them already.

## Installation

You need to install [Node](http://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.  Then:

`npm install adhesive -g`

Or you can clone this repository, `cd` into into it, and run `npm install`, then `npm link`.  That's a good option if you want to try modifying adhesive.

## Usage

`adhesive <config_path> [--debug | --dont-minify | --help]`

Your config file must have a .json extension.  You may omit the extension when invoking adhesive. For example, if your configuration file is named `build.json`, the following are equivalent:

`adhesive build`<br/>
`adhesive build.json`

### Flags

`--debug`
- Compiles a source map and saves it alongside the built JavaScript (in previous versions you could put the source maps in
a different folder, but it was very confusing to configure so I've removed it).

`--no-uglify`
- Will tell adhesive to only concatenate your code (no uglifying), which is useful if you need to debug something in a browser that doesn't support source maps.

`--help`
- Displays this information in the terminal.

### Automation

#### Nodemon

I recommend using [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) with adhesive to recombine your code each time you make a change.  Thanks to source maps, this allows you to have a nice workflow that is pretty much identical to using `<script>` tags:

`npm install nodemon -g`<br/>
`nodemon adhesive build --debug`

__Important:__ note that if you install adhesive from npm or use `npm link`, you'll need to use nodemon's `--exec` mode:

`nodemon --exec adhesive build --debug --watch src-js`

You'll notice that I used the `--watch` option to specify the watch folder.  In this example I'm building to the 'js' folder, but all my constituent files are in 'src-js'.  

The reason is simple: if you use nodemon to execute adhesive and the latter saves its output to the same folder nodemon is watching (such as the project directory), you'll wind up with a crazy infinite loop because nodemon will detect adhesive's output as a change.  

#### IntelliJ Platform File Watchers

## Configuration

The configuration file is a JSON document (as noted above, you can name it anything, but I recommend `build.json`).  It requires that you specify an array of source files and an output path, like so:

```json
{
    "sources":[
        "swipe.js",
        "PxLoader.js",
        "PxLoaderImage.js",
        "main.js"
    ],
    "outputPath":"main_built.js"
}
```
It probably goes without saying that the sources are concatenated in the order listed, so if your site currently has a list of script tags, you'll want to maintain that same order in here.

### Optional Parameters

#### sourceRoot
You can set a `sourceRoot` path that will be prepended to the file paths in the `sources` array:

```json
{
    "sourceRoot":"src",
    "sources":[
        "vendor/swipe.js",
        "vendor/PxLoader.js",
        "vendor/PxLoaderImage.js",
        "main.js"
    ],
    "outputPath":"js/main_built.js"
}
```

#### uglifyGlobals
You can define globals that will be injected during the Uglifying process (when the `--debug` option is _not_ used). [Find out why you might want to do this](http://jstarrdewar.com/blog/2013/02/28/use-uglify-to-automatically-strip-debug-messages-from-your-javascript/) on my blog. Use a hash called `uglifyGlobals`:

```json
{
    "sourceRoot":"src",
    "sources":[
        "vendor/swipe.js",
        "vendor/PxLoader.js",
        "vendor/PxLoaderImage.js",
        "main.js"
    ],
    "uglifyGlobals": {
        "DEBUG":false
    },
    "outputPath":"js/main_built.js"
}
```

## Version History

#### 1.0.1
- Fixed security warning from outdated version of UglifyJS

#### 1.0.0
- Added configurable definition of globals for uglify (instead of always being DEBUG:false).
- Moved some code to helpers.js to facilitate unit tests.
- Added Jasmine specs.
- Removed `sourceMap` configuration hash because it was confusing.  Now uses sensible default of saving the source map with the built file.
- Decided to call it 1.0, because I don't think there's much left to add at this point.

#### 0.1.1
- Fixed a bug thanks to Adrian Unger.

#### 0.1.0
- Initial release.
